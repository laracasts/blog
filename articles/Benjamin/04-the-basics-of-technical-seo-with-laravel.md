## 1. Technical SEO is only 20% of the job

SEO is a content creation game. The more you write, the more are your chances to get traffic from search engines.

That being said, your website must tick a few boxes:
- Search engines will be able to figure out what your pages are about.
- They are also looking to rank pages offering a decent user experience (we will see later what this means).

Technical SEO may only be 20% of the job, but _it is necessary_.

## 2. Avoid superstitions and fact check everything

SEO is well-known for old supertitions that stick. Most of them are spread by auto-proclamed gurus or by paid SEO tools that want you to believe SEO is more complicated than it is.

Some of the superstitions are based on misconceptions due to the fact that Google ranking algorithm is not open source, or practices that were best a few years back, but are not used anymore. And some are even completely made up.

Let's review old beliefs tied to technical SEO:
- Using a meta tags for keywords like `<meta name=“keywords” content=“keyword 1, keyword 2, keyword 3” />` can make you rank better for the keywords you chose to target. It's obviously false and it's been ditched by Google so many years ago!
- Google cannot render JavaScript. This has been true for a while, but it's not anymore. Hence the need to fact check everything because Google moves fast! (We will talk about this in more details later.)

There are dozens of false beliefs that a lot of people still apply hoping to make the SEO gods happy. But you must never trust what you read outside of Google's documentation. Some Google employees are also good sources of truth and you can trust them for the most part.

## 3. Don't be religious about the PageSpeed Insights test

## 4. Don't overthink meta tags, they won't help you rank higher

## 5. Google renders non-server-side rendered pages, but don't ditch SSR yet!

## 6. Monitor for errors, because Google will hide you from search results in case of issues
