## Technical SEO is only 20% of the job

SEO is a content creation game. The more you write, the more are your chances to get traffic from search engines.

That being said, your website must tick a few boxes:
- Search engines will be able to figure out what your pages are about.
- They are also looking to rank pages offering a decent user experience (we will see later what this means).

Technical SEO may only be 20% of the job, but _it is necessary_.

## Avoid superstitions and fact check everything

## Don't be religious about the PageSpeed Insights test

## Don't overthink meta tags, they won't help you rank higher

## Google renders non-server-side rendered pages, but don't ditch SSR yet!

## Monitor for errors, because Google will hide you from search results in case of issues
