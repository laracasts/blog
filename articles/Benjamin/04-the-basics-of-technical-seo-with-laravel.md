## Technical SEO is only 20% of the job

## Fact check everything, avoid superstitions

## Don't take the PageSpeed Insights test too seriously

## Don't overthink meta tags, they won't help you rank higher

## Google renders non-server-side rendered pages, but don't ditch SSR yet!

## Monitor for errors, because Google will hide you from search results in case of issues
