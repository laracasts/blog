## 1. Technical SEO is only 20% of the job

SEO is a content creation game. The more you write, the more your chances to get traffic from search engines.

That being said, your website must tick a few boxes:
- Search engines must be able to figure out what your pages are about. There are multiple ways to make sure of it.
- They are also looking to rank pages offering a decent user experience (we will see later what this means).

Technical SEO may only be 20% of the job, but _it is necessary_.

## 2. Avoid superstitions and fact-check everything

SEO is well-known for old superstitions that stick. Most of them are spread by auto-proclaimed gurus or by paid SEO tools that want you to believe SEO is more complicated than it is.

Some of the superstitions are based on:
- Misconceptions due to the fact that Google's and other search engines' ranking algorithms are not open source.
- Practices that were best a few years back, but are not used anymore. And some are even completely made up. Again, not knowing how their algorithm work helps spread incorrect information.

Let's review old beliefs tied to technical SEO:
- Using a meta tag for keywords like `<meta name=“keywords” content=“keyword 1, keyword 2, keyword 3” />` can make you rank better for the keywords you chose to target. It's obviously false and it's been ditched by search engines so many years ago!
- Google cannot render JavaScript. This has been true for a while, but it's not anymore. Hence the need to fact-check everything because Google moves fast! (We will discuss this in more detail later because other search engines might not be as cutting-edge.)

There are dozens of false beliefs that a lot of people still apply hoping to make the SEO gods happy. But you must never trust what you read outside of a search engine's documentation. Some employees are also good sources of truth and you can trust them for the most part.

## 3. How to debunk false information about SEO

Let's imagine you heard that performing well on social media boosts your rankings on Google. It's also called "social signals." Before going all-in on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and others, you want to ensure this is true so you don't invest in something that won't bring any return on investment.

## 4. Don't be religious about the PageSpeed Insights test

## 5. Don't overthink meta tags, they won't help you rank higher

## 6. Google renders non-server-side rendered pages, but don't ditch SSR yet!

## 7. Monitor for errors, because Google will hide you from search results in case of issues
