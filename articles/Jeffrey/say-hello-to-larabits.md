Fun fact. Laracasts originally launched back in 2013 as a collection of isolated video tutorials. One video, one technique, move on to something else. There wasn’t yet any concept of a series or course. But not long after the launch, I ran into a handful of hurdles.

*   What about topics that can’t be contained within a fifteen-minute video?
*   How do you present a recommended viewing order for related topics?

Of course these are obvious roadblocks in hindsight, but my original thinking was for Laracasts to function as a sort of magazine. Visit the site, “flip” through a few videos, pick up some tips, and then get back to work. This is how I typically learn new things. I rarely find myself working through multi-hour courses.

But, still, those two hurdles mentioned above needed to be solved. If I want to teach the basics of Laravel, it’s not enough to have one random video on routes, another on controllers, etc. There absolutely needs to be a recommended viewing order - particularly for newcomers. So I added support for dedicated courses on the site - and this is [what you see on the site](https://laracasts.com/series) today.

And yes, that did fix the problem. But over time, _I worry that the original “magazine” feel I was initially going for has since disappeared_. We never technically removed the ability to publish isolated video tutorials. Instead, they just sort of died off in favor of longer, dedicated series.

## Larabits

With all that in mind, I’m now solving the same problem - but this time in reverse. Full Laracasts series will never go away, but we will release supplementary video tutorials that are branded under the name, [Larabits](https://laracasts.com/bits).

> Larabits are short, targeted lessons that focus on a single trick or technique.

Not only will this [new section](https://laracasts.com/bits) be a place for the teachers here at Laracasts to branch off into topics or technologies that don’t necessarily warrant a dedicated series, but it will also allow us to immediately review and discuss new advancements in the ecosystem.

[We’ve launched with six initial lessons](https://laracasts.com/bits), and will naturally expand this catalog every week. My goal is to frequently commission guest contributions from some of the most notable developers in the community.

On this note, a quick kudos to Adrian Tudor - our design lead - for his excellent branding work as we prepared to launch this new section of the site. I originally came to him with the rough concept of building a new page for quicker, focused videos. He then took that information and created “Larabits,” which includes a fun and colorful 8-bit theme, the monster mascot, and a new three-second intro sting that plays before every Larabit.

_This is a great example of taking a very basic concept, and elevating it to something that feels special._

Hopefully, this will encourage you to visit the site more frequently than you otherwise would have. [Happy learning](https://laracasts.com/bits)!
